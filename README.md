# bavar

A domain-specific build system for AVR C/C++ projects with a strong opinion about how to build them.
It is developed as part of the [LabAvrPlatform](https://github.com/dx3mod/LabAvrPlatform) project, but can be used separately.

The project is currently in active development. :construction:
